 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
When prioritizing tasks based on dependencies and project deadlines, the development engineer should first identify all the tasks required to implement each user story. Then, they should analyze the dependencies between tasks to determine the order in which they need to be completed. Tasks that are dependent on others should be prioritized accordingly to ensure smooth progress.

Additionally, project deadlines should be taken into consideration when prioritizing tasks. Tasks that are critical to meeting project milestones or deadlines should be given higher priority to ensure timely delivery of the product.

By carefully considering dependencies and project deadlines, the development engineer can effectively prioritize tasks to ensure efficient and successful project execution.
