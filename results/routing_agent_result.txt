Routing Response 2: Rome, Italy, has a rich and extensive history that dates back over 2,800 years. It was founded in 753 BC according to legend by Romulus and Remus, twin brothers who were raised by a she-wolf. Rome started as a small settlement on the banks of the Tiber River and grew to become the capital of the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic, and later the Roman Empire.

The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in history, known for its advancements in architecture, engineering, law, and military tactics. Rome's expansion led to the establishment of an extensive empire that encompassed much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Throughout its history, Rome faced internal conflicts, civil wars, and invasions by various barbarian tribes. The decline of the Western Roman Empire is often attributed to factors such as economic instability, political corruption, and external pressures from invading tribes such as the Visigoths and Vandals.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome went through a period of decline and fragmentation. However, the city remained an important religious and cultural center, particularly with the rise of Christianity. The Papal States were established in the 8th century, with the Pope becoming a powerful figure in the city.

In the 19th century, Rome became the capital of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy. The city underwent significant urban renewal and development, with landmarks such as the Victor Emmanuel II Monument and the Altare della Patria being built during this time.

Today, Rome is a vibrant and bustling city that attracts millions of tourists each year who come to see its ancient ruins, historic sites, and world-renowned art and architecture. It remains a symbol of Italy's rich cultural heritage and its enduring legacy as the center of one of the greatest civilizations in history.
